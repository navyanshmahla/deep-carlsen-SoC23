# Deep Carlsen

Welcome to the Season of Code (SoC) 2023 project *Deep Carlsen*. 
Mentors: **Navyansh Mahla**, **Atishay Jain**

## What is the project all about?
The project aims at building a chess engine model using Deep Learning unlike the traditional ways of brute force game theoretic algorithms. This area of automating chess is actively researched by a lot of game theorists, computer scientists and machine learning researchers. We must mention beforehand that this project, due to its programming and mathematical rigour might be a bit intense for some complete beginners. But you guys need not worry, that's what we are here for ;)

## A note to all the mentees:


**What will we be doing?**
While doing the project, you'd often get a taste of what doing research feels like. 
There are a lot of blogs, and research papers out there for you to study and implement them to build an efficient chess engine. Often times, there are different algorithms to achieve the same. Later on in the project, we'll be sharing with you guys some blogs and research paper. You can choose a paper/blog of your liking and implement that in code. We can then match them up against each other to see which chess engine works better. For example: A possible strategy of implementing a chess engine uses reinforcement learning and the other one uses autoencoder neural nets. Let's say one of the mentee implements the RL one and the other implements auto encoder. We can then match their engines against each other to see which strategy works better. This will make this more fun and would also give you an idea of which algorithm is more efficient and how well you have implemented the paper.

**What can you expect from us mentors?**
Well, whenever you're stuck, feel free to contact us either through a call, or by sliding through our DMs. We can help you with resources, giving you a defined roadmap for the project and helping you debug your code.

**What can we not help you with, unfortunately?**
Please refrain from any such request like asking us the direct code for implementation just to copy and paste it.

And lastly:
**New ideas? You're welcome!**
As you know, there can be multiple algos which can be used to implement a chess engine using DL. Most of you would be implementing the research papers or blogs for it (which we'll decide later). But if anyone of you comes up with his own neural net architecture for this problem, we can have a brief discussion about the same to implement it, or even write our own blog/paper on this ;)


# The workflow:

Week 1: Learning Python basics
Week 2: Learning deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow/PyTorch, and deciding upon which paper/blog/idea to implement
Week 3: Thoroughly reading the research paper and developing a rough plan of its implementation.
Week 4: Implementing the model.
Week 5: Implementing rest of the engine 
Week 6: Writing a detailed writup explaining your thought process and idea while implementing the paper with the link to the video showing the working demo of your engine.
